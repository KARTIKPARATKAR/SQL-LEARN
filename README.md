# SQL-LEARN
**SQL** stands for **Structured Query Language** which is used for storing, retrieving, managing and manipulating data within the **Database Mnagement System(DBMS)**.
I have followed a Youtube video of WebDevSimplified where he has introduced us with SQL and explained some of the important SQL queries that can be learned.

Link of that youtube video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3qvj9hO_Bo&t=30s)
